## Welcome

I have developed quite a few numerical codes. They can be used to explore the secrets and exotic properties of strongly correlated systems. Their source codes and documentations are collected and presented here.

## Flink

## ACFlow

*A Full-Fledged Analytical Continuation Toolkit in Julia*

* [Source](https://github.com/huangli712/ACFlow)

* [Source](https://github.com/huangli712/iQIST)
* [Documentation](projects/iqist_new/index.html) (New version. To be updated.)

## Zen

In addition, I also write some tools to facilitate my programming practice. They are listed below.
