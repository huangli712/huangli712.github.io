It depends on the Dash web framework, and provide an useful ui to facilite analytic continuation calculations. Now ACGui supports three analytic continuation solvers:\n\nMaximum Entropy Method (MaxEnt solver, recommended)\nBarycentric Rational Function Method (BarRat solver, recommended)\nStochastic Pole eXpansion (StochPX solver, recommended)\n\nThe MaxEnt and BarRat solvers are extremely fast, so users can obtain the calculated results quickly. However, the StochPX solver is quite slow. It is not a good idea to start calculations with it through ACGui. In such cases, users can download the relevant ac.toml files from the app, and then submit tasks manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"library.html#Layouts","page":"Library","title":"Layouts","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"library.html","page":"Library","title":"Library","text":"acg_layout!\nlayout_header_block\nlayout_data_block\nlayout_base_block\nlayout_maxent_block\nlayout_barrat_block\nlayout_stochpx_block\nlayout_calc_block\nlayout_about_block","category":"page"},{"location":"library.html#ACGui.acg_layout!","page":"Library","title":"ACGui.acg_layout!","text":"acg_layout!(app::Dash.DashApp)\n\nGlobal layout for the ACGui app.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"library.html#ACGui.layout_header_block","page":"Library","title":"ACGui.layout_header_block","text":"layout_header_block()\n\nLayout for the header part.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"library.html#ACGui.layout_data_block","page":"Library","title":"ACGui.layout_data_block","text":"layout_data_block()\n\nLayout for the data tab.
